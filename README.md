# tic tac toe

Implementation of the tic-tac-toe game using the nannou lib, te game is fully responsive and I've done it as a first side project in rust in order to finnish something in Rust.

As you see the game looks clean and simple, just a tic-tac-toe.

As you can see there is some higlighting to higlight the winning movement and also for tie.
